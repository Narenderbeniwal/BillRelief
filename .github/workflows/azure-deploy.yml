# Deploy BillRelief to Azure App Service (free tier)
#
# Uses Azure Login (service principal). Required for deployment slots.
#
# 1. Azure Portal → Microsoft Entra ID → App registrations → New registration
# 2. Certificates & secrets → New client secret → copy value
# 3. Subscription → Access control (IAM) → Add role assignment:
#    Role: Website Contributor (or Contributor), Assignable to: User, group, or service principal → select your app
# 4. GitHub → Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret:
#    Name: AZURE_CREDENTIALS
#    Value: {"clientId":"<app-client-id>","clientSecret":"<secret-value>","subscriptionId":"<subscription-id>","tenantId":"<directory-tenant-id>"}
#    (Find subscription ID and tenant ID in Azure Portal → Microsoft Entra ID → Overview / Subscriptions)
#
# For PayPal and NextAuth to work on the deployed site, add these GitHub Secrets (they are inlined at build time):
#   NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID   - your PayPal client ID
#   NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_MODE       - "live" or "sandbox"
#   NEXTAUTH_URL                  - e.g. https://billrelief.azurewebsites.net (optional; has default)
#   NEXTAUTH_SECRET               - same value as in Azure App Service config (optional for build; required at runtime via Azure)
